[Radio France](https://www.radiofrance.fr), [Orange Labs](https://www.orange.fr), [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr) and [France Televisions](https://www.francetelevisions.fr) are happy to
announce the release of their open-source Peak Limiter:

This development allows the owners of web/app players to provide
additional gain while preventing the output signal to clip.
For the mobile listening of programmes that respect the broadcast
dynamic requirements (-24 LKFS/-23 LUFS), this Peak Limiter allows an
additional gain of 8 dB to offer the suitable output level in a noisy
environment.

This on-demand feature, controlled by the user according to his/her
listening conditions, allows contents providers to deliver the same mix
over broadcast and OTT networks. This Peak Limiter can be driven by
metadata or keeps the signal below 0 dBTP by default.
